# LynxSherpa

## Caution: not thouroughly tested!
## CAUTION: Rn it seems as if the wear on the gears is quite high
I have to do some additional testion concerning this but rn I would not use it

## Why another Sherpa:
I was looking for a new extruder as my Orbiter started dying on me and had my eyes on the sherpa mini.
Doing a bit more research, I looked at the sailfin and found a mod keep the tensioner open for easier filament swaps which led to look for mods of the sherpa mini as well in my pursuit of finding the perfect extruder.
I stumbled across the Sherpa Zero and thought it looked promising, though it had 4 major drawbacks imo:
- It was not RIDGA compatible and my RIDGA gears were already on their way, so using RIDGA was set in stone
- Having the angle adjustment screw on the tensioning arm defeats it's whole purpose imo
- The bridge on the front housing just doesn't really look good when printed
- No way to add a bowden collet (well this carries over from the original sherpa mini)

That's where the LynxSherpa comes in:
The angle adjustment screw now sits in the front housing, the bridge is gone, the cad is cleaned up, it is RIDGA compatible and there is a core piece ready for a bowden collet (the small one that's used on the hextrudort or orbiter).
When adjusting the angle adjusment screw, make sure to leave a little play, you'd rather still have a little bit of wood grain than worn out gears.


## Workings:
The general idea is the same as with the Sherpa Zero, the adjustment screw is just fixed now instead of in the tensioning arm.
I would also advise to use a nylon screw to not damage the axle of the idler gear. <br>

## File names:
There are 2 different tensioning arms like with the original sherpa mini: a long and a short one.
There are also 2 version of the core: the default one (dubbed normal) and one which will accept a bowden collet (dubbed collet)
For the front housing there are 4 versions: a normal one and one for extruder mounts like on the armchair xol where you can add one screw from the front (dubbed XOL).
Both of those versions feature a version for a "long" angle adjustment screw (m3x8) or a short one (m3x6).
There is also a file for a printed version of the m5x7x0.5 shim.
The optional folder contains a Turbiter mod which fits the LynxSherpa (and the normal sherpa) on an Armchair XOL.

## Changelog

### v1-0-1
- adjusted the size of the printed shim to be a snug fit on the axle so it doesn't slide off on it's own when disassembling the extruder
- added a little groove in the face plate so it looks nicer
- added printable m3 shims, I used one on the m3x20 axle of the tensioning arm (facing the core) and 2 on the idler grae axle, one on each side (totally optional)

### v1-0-0
Initial release
