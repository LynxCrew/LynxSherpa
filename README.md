# LynxSherpa

## Why another Sherpa:
I was looking for a new extruder as my Orbiter started dying on me and had my eyes on the sherpa mini.
Doing a bit more research, I looked at the sailfin and found a mod keep the tensioner open for easier filament swaps which led to look for mods of the sherpa mini as well in my pursuit of finding the perfect extruder.
I stumbled across the Sherpa Zero and thought it looked promising, though it had 4 major drawbacks imo:
- It was not RIDGA compatible and my RIDGA gears were already on their way, so using RIDGA was set in stone
- Having the angle adjustment screw on the tensioning arm defeats it's whole purpose imo
- The bridge on the front housing just doesn't really look good when printed
- No way to add a bowden collet (well this carries over from the original sherpa mini)

That's where the LynxSherpa comes in:
The angle adjustment screw now sits in the front housing, the bridge is gone, the cad is cleaned up, it is RIDGA compatible and there is a core piece ready for a bowden collet (the small one that's used on the hextrudort or orbiter)
Also the adjustment screw sits on the left by default now, if you want the standard Sherpa look, just mirror each part in the slicer and you are good to go.


## Workings:
The general idea is the same as with the Sherpa Zero, the adjustment screw is just fixed now instead of in the tensioning arm.
I would also advise to use a nylon screw to not damage the axle of the idler gear.


## File names:
There are 2 different tensioning arms like with the original sherpa mini: a long and a short one.
There are also 2 version of the core: the default one (dubbed normal) and one which will accept a bowden collet (dubbed collet)
For the front housing there are 4 versions: a normal one and one for extruder mounts like on the armchair xol where you can add one screw from the front (dubbed XOL).
Both of those versions feature a version for a "long" angle adjustment screw (m3x8) or a short one (m3x6).
There is also a file for a printed version of the m5x7x0.5 shim.
